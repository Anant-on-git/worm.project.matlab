# worm.project.matlab
This project is focused on building a deep learning  model, which could predict if the worms in the image are dead or alive.<br>
Project workflow: <br>
1. importing data<br>
2. split into train and test sets<br>
3. augmentment the data<br>
4. load & modify the pretrained network<br>
5. train the network on trainset<br>
6. classify the test data<br>
7. analyze the performance<br>
